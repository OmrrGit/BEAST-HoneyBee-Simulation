# BEAST-HoneyBee-Simulation

This project aims to create a demo using the Bioinspired Evolutionary Agent Simulation Toolkit (BEAST for short) courseware that simulates the behaviours of honeybee colonies. This includes foraging and reproductive behaviour, attempting to provide a natural feeling to the autonomous agents implemented in the simulation using numerous principles from other existing solutions for modelling various intelligent creatures. This will go into depth about these honey bee behaviours and how they can exist in nature, as well as the algorithms and simulations that these processes have inspired. This is also an attempt to demonstrate BEASTâ€™s capabilities as an educational tool, attempting to show the capabilities of bioinspired computing.

## Compilation and usage

This code can be run on the school Linux computers by following the instructions in BEAST/README.md

## Statement of Contributions

This project is an extension of the existing BEAST software made by Omer Gelli (zdqg7185) with the following implementations:

  - Bee Utility Functions [beeutilfunc.h]
  - Honey Bees Simulation [bees.cc]
